  "instruction": "This is a basic maze navigation game where players control a ball sprite using arrow keys to move through a maze. The ball bounces off blue walls and the goal is to reach a target sprite that displays 'You win!' when touched. But now in this Maze Starter, the maze doesn't recognize when the ball reaches the goal and doesn't trigger a win response. Please help me fix this goal detection issue so that the maze properly recognizes when the ball reaches the goal and triggers a win response.",
