Users can drag the sprite around or use input prompts to move it by specific amounts, with real-time coordinate feedback and mode switching between drag and input modes. But now the Input Numbers button (the 'Button' sprite) disappears when clicked and doesn't reappear, fix this issue so users can switch modes seamlessly.",
