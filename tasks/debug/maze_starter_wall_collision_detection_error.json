  "instruction": "This is a basic maze navigation game where players control a ball sprite using arrow keys to move through a maze. The ball bounces off blue walls and the goal is to reach a target sprite that displays 'You win!' when touched. But now in this Maze Starter, the ball can pass through maze walls. Please help me fix this wall collision detection issue so that the ball cannot clip through walls.",
