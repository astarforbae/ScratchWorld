  "instruction": "This is a basic maze navigation game where players control a ball sprite using arrow keys to move through a maze. The ball bounces off blue walls and the goal is to reach a target sprite that displays 'You win!' when touched. But now in this Maze Starter, movement steps are too large and cause collision checks to miss walls. Please help me fix this movement issue so that the ball moves in the correct directions with a proper step size.",
