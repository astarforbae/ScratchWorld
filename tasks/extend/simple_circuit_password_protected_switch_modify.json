  "instruction": "This is an interactive circuit simulation where users can drag and connect a battery, switch, and lightbulb to complete an electrical circuit. When all components are properly connected and the switch is turned on, the lightbulb illuminates with sound effects. Please modify the switch behavior so that when clicked, it prompts for a password saying: 'What is the password?'. Set a fixed password ('1234'). Only if the entered password matches exactly and circuit is complete (connections complete = 3) should the switch turn ON. If the password is wrong, the switch should remain OFF. The switch should still be able to turn OFF normally without requiring a password.",
