  "instruction": "This is a basic maze navigation game where players control a ball sprite using arrow keys to move through a maze. The ball bounces off blue walls and the goal is to reach a target sprite that displays 'You win!' when touched. To add an additional gameplay challenge, implement the following feature: make the Obstacle sprite continuously patrol along a path (move and bounce on edge). If the Ball touches the Obstacle, reset Ball to the start position.",
