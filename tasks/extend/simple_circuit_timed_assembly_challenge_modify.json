  "instruction": "This is an interactive circuit simulation where users can drag and connect a battery, a switch, and a lightbulb to complete an electrical circuit. When all components are properly connected and the switch is turned on, the lightbulb illuminates with sound effects. Please add a simple 10-second countdown timer implemented on the Stage. 1. The countdown variable must be named \"timeLeft\". 2. When the \"timeLeft\" countdown finishes (reaches 0), stop all scripts.",
