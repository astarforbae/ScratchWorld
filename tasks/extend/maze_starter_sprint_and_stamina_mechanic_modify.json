  "instruction": "This is a basic maze navigation game where players control a ball sprite using arrow keys to move through a maze. The ball bounces off blue walls and the goal is to reach a target sprite that displays 'You win!' when touched. Add a sprint mode toggled by the space key, using a 'stamina' variable (0-20). When sprinting, the ball moves 15 steps and stamina decreases by 1 per tick; if stamina reaches 0, it must automatically switch back to normal mode. When in normal mode, the ball moves 10 steps and stamina regenerates by 1 per tick. Complete the remaining blocks.",
