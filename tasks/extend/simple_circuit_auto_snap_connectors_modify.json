  "instruction": "This is an interactive circuit simulation where users can drag and connect a battery, switch, and lightbulb to complete an electrical circuit. When all components are properly connected and the switch is turned on, the lightbulb illuminates with sound effects. Please add a functionality that when the Battery sprite is dragged close to the terminal position (-180, 5), it automatically glides to that exact position. The snapping should occur when the Battery is within a Manhattan distance of 50 from the target position (|x - (-180)| + |y - 5| < 50).",
