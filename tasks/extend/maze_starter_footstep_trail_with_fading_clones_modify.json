  "instruction": "This is a basic maze navigation game where players control a ball sprite using arrow keys to move through a maze. The ball bounces off blue walls and the goal is to reach a target sprite that displays 'You win!' when touched. Create a clone-based trail effect. In the Ball sprite, periodically create clones while moving. In 'when I start as a clone', set the clone's ghost effect to 0, then in a repeat loop increase ghost by a small amount until the clone becomes invisible, then delete the clone. Ensure clones do not affect gameplay by spacing clone creation.",
