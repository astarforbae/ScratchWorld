  "instruction": "This is a simple flying game where a cat sprite can be controlled with arrow keys to fly up and down while buildings scroll continuously across the screen from right to left, creating a side-scrolling flight experience. We want to add a feature where collecting a power-up item slows down the buildings. The project already includes a 'Power Up' sprite and a `glideDuration` variable to control the 'Buildings' sprite's speed. Please program the 'Power Up' sprite to generate a clone every few seconds at a random y-position on the right side of the screen that moves toward the left. When the cat touches a 'Power Up' clone, delete the clone and increase the `glideDuration` of the buildings to slow them down.",
