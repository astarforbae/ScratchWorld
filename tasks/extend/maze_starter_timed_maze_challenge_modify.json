  "instruction": "This is a basic maze navigation game where players control a ball sprite using arrow keys to move through a maze. The ball bounces off blue walls and the goal is to reach a target sprite that displays 'You win!' when touched. Enhance the Maze Starter by adding two variables: timeLeft and score. On green flag: set timeLeft to 60 and score to 0. Start a forever loop that waits 1 second and decreases timeLeft by 1 until it reaches 0, at which point the game ends and all scripts should stop. While moving, if the Ball is touching the wall color, change score by -1 and push the Ball back. When the Ball reaches the goal, award a +50 score bonus and stop the timer.",
