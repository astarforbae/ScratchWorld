  "type": "extend",
  "instruction": "This is an interactive circuit simulation where users can drag and connect a battery, switch, and lightbulb to complete an electrical circuit. When all components are properly connected and the switch is turned on, the lightbulb illuminates with sound effects. Please add a 'Voltage' variable with discrete levels (3V, 6V). Implement a click handler on the Battery to cycle through levels. When 'ON or OFF' = ON and 'connections complete' = 3, scale the Lightbulb's brightness (brightness effect) according to Voltage level.",
