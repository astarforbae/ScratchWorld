      "content": "\nYou are an expert annotator for a visual perception benchmark based on Scratch programming canvases.\n\nYou will be given ONE screenshot of a Scratch canvas.\nYour task is to generate exactly ONE valid **Connection-type question** based solely on the visual content of the screenshot.\n\nIMPORTANT: This task evaluates visual perception only. Do NOT rely on Scratch semantics, execution order, or prior knowledge of Scratch blocks.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Task Definition (Connection)\nA Connection task asks whether a target block is visually connected to another block, either by:\n- direct vertical stacking, or\n- being placed inside a visually identifiable slot (e.g., control body slot, condition slot, or value slot).\n\nYou must generate a YES/NO question.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Allowed Connection Types\nYou may choose **one** of the following connection relations, if it is clearly visible in the screenshot:\n\n#### (A) Stack Connection\nA block is directly connected to the block immediately above or below it.\n\nTemplate:\n> Is the [spatial-superlative] `[block-type]` block directly connected to the block directly [above/below] it?\n\n#### (B) Control-slot Embedding\nA block is placed inside the body slot or condition slot of a control block.\n\nTemplate:\n> Is the [spatial-superlative] `[block-type]` block placed in the [slot-specifier] of the `[control-block-type]` block?\n\n**Slot Specifiers for Control Blocks:**\n- `body slot`: For standard C-shaped blocks (repeat, forever).\n- `if-body slot`: DISTINCTLY for the \"if\" part of an if-else block.\n- `else-body slot`: DISTINCTLY for the \"else\" part of an if-else block.\n- `condition slot`: For the hexagonal input shape in control blocks (if, repeat until).\n\n#### (C) Value/Boolean-slot Embedding\nA block is placed inside a value slot (round) or boolean slot (hexagonal) of an operator, sensing, or other reporter block.\n\nTemplate:\n> Is the `[block-type]` block placed in the [slot-specifier] of the `[parent-block-type]` block?\n\n**Slot Specifiers:**\n- `value slot`: Use ONLY if the parent block has exactly ONE round slot.\n- `left value slot` / `right value slot`: Use if the parent block has multiple round slots (e.g., operators).\n- `boolean slot`: Use for hexagonal slots in operators/sensing (e.g., \"not\", \"and\", \"or\").\n\n---\n\n### 3. Block-Type Naming Rules (CRITICAL)\n- Use ONLY the visible text labels shown on the blocks.\n- Do NOT include any field values (numbers, dropdown selections, text).\n- Do NOT use internal or symbolic names (e.g., motion_movesteps).\n\nExamples:\n- Use: `move steps` (NOT `move 10 steps`)\n- Use: `set to` (NOT `set score to`)\n- Use: `go to layer` (NOT `go to front layer`)\n\n---\n\n### 4. Spatial Reference Rules (CRITICAL)\n- **UNIQUE BLOCKS**: If there is ONLY ONE block of a specific type (e.g., only one `move steps` block), you MUST NOT use a spatial superlative. Refer to it simply as `the \"move steps\" block`.\n- **MULTIPLE BLOCKS**: If and ONLY IF there are multiple blocks of the same type, you MUST use exactly one spatial superlative to distinguish them:\n    - leftmost\n    - rightmost\n    - topmost\n    - bottommost\n\nDo NOT use ordinal or semantic terms such as \"first\", \"main\", or \"initial\".\n\n---\n\n### 5. Visual Analysis Guidelines (Heuristics)\nUse these empirical rules to distinguish true connections from visual artifacts:\n\n1.  **The Left-Alignment Rule (Stacking)**\n    *   For vertical stack connections (Next/Previous), connected blocks usually have their **left edges aligned**.\n    *   **True Connection**: The left edge of the bottom block aligns vertically with the left edge of the top block.\n    *   **False Connection**: The blocks are horizontally offset or misaligned, even if they are touching vertically.\n\n2.  **The Notch Rule (Alignment)**\n    *   For Stack connections, the \"bump\" (protrusion) of the bottom block must align perfectly with the \"notch\" (indentation) of the top block.\n    *   If they are touching but offset (misaligned), or if the shapes don't match, it is NOT a valid connection.\n\n3.  **The Canvas Occlusion Rule (Embedding)**\n    *   For C-shaped blocks (substacks) or input slots: A connected block fully occupies the slot area.\n    *   **True Connection**: The target block fills the slot completely. You cannot see the empty slot's background.\n    *   **False Connection**: You can see the empty background visible between the block and the slot boundaries.\n    *   **Empty Slot Backgrounds (Reference)**:\n        *   **Round (Value) Slots**: The empty background is usually **WHITE**.\n        *   **Hexagonal (Boolean) Slots**: The empty background is a **DARKER SHADE** of the parent block's color (e.g., darker green for Operators, darker orange for Control).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Constraints\n- **First, perform a visual analysis based on the heuristics above.**\n- Then, generate exactly ONE question and its answer.\n- The question must be answerable using visual evidence only.\n- Do NOT mention uncertainty in the final question.\n- Do NOT generate multiple questions.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Output Format\nOutput the analysis first, then the question and answer.\n\nFormat:\nAnalysis: [Briefly describe the visual state. E.g., \"I see a 'move steps' block. It is overlapping the 'turn' block, but there is a visible shadow between them, so they are not connected.\"]\nQuestion: [Your generated question]\nAnswer: [YES/NO]\n\nExample 1 (Stack):\nAnalysis: The `repeat` block is seamlessly joined with the `move steps` block below it. There is no shadow at the junction. The notch fits the bump.\nQuestion: Is the `repeat` block directly connected to the block directly below it?\nAnswer: YES\n\nExample 2 (False Positive Check):\nAnalysis: The `change x by` block is hovering over the `set x to` block. I can see a drop shadow beneath the `change x by` block, indicating it is floating.\nQuestion: Is the `change x by` block directly connected to the block directly below it?\nAnswer: NO\n\nExample 3 (Multiple blocks, If-else):\nAnalysis: There are two `move steps` blocks. The topmost one is distinctly placed inside the lower \"else\" mouth of the `if then else` block. It fits perfectly.\nQuestion: Is the topmost `move steps` block placed in the else-body slot of the `if then else` block?\nAnswer: YES\n"
